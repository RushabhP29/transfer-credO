1,FALSE,The report claims they are asking for $1 million.,"BuzzFeed first reported this, citing ""Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates."" None of the sources were named.","ANTAKYA, Turkey  Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody  instead beheading three of them since July  its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed. Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands. They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal. If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity  as well as the group's cold calculation as it works to raise more cash. At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley's death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands. All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety. One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria's civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra's custody. This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley's family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,"" he said. ""They will not give the DNA without the money."" He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work ""a humanity case."" Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: ""This is business."" The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley's body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages. Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley's remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal. Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley's parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son's release. ""It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,"" the FSA official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive."" The FSA official described himself as the ""manager"" of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family. As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. ""They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,"" the FSA official said. The Foley family had no comment for this article. An official with the U.S. State Department said ""we are seeking more information"" on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea ""disgusting."" With additional reporting by Munzer al-Awad in Turkey.",ISIS Is Trying To Sell The Body Of U.S. Hostage James Foley For $1 Million
1,FALSE,"The order was reportedly issued by his father, in 2011.",South Koreaâ€™s KBS TV station reported that it obtained a North Korea government document that said: â€œAll party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.â€,"Officials ordered to make citizens named after leader change their names, according to document obtained by South Korean TV A year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it  maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive states ruling Kim dynasty, a report said. An internal state document obtained by South Koreas KBS TV station contains an administrative order from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his fathers successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year. All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-un  and train them to voluntarily change their names, said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday. The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un. Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip  regarding this project, it added. The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seouls unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine. But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il. Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now, the official said. The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced. There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un, Park, who defected in 2008, said.",North Korea directive reveals apparent ban on sharing Kim Jong-uns name

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015. According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect. Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation. Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach. But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

ONeill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm. Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of ONeills. Mr. ONeill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. ONeill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. ONeill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house! commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled. ONeill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero. It was nothing really. Those kids didnt have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed.

It actually started out as a joke, Snowden said in his speech. Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption Im watching you, and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle. Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians? Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it, Snowden said. The elves have basic mobility, which isnt a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected, Snowden added, its just assumed to be part of the game. Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas. We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community, Snowden said. Especially for Tailored Access Operations. In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed. The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information, journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. They can tell things about peoples health  cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know whos being naughty, and whos being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldnt provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains  all the things stashed in closets and under beds. Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the governments leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least. If you want to know why the privacy advocates have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody, Snowden said.

The story cites anonymous former neighbors who it says confirmed that it is DeJesus' voice on the videos, and that she was a porn actor. It also reported that the ex-wife of DeJesus's partner confirmed that the couple is behind the YouTube account. Due to the abundance of anonymous sources and the lack of definitive proof that DeJesus is the woman in the videos, and that she was a porn star, we are keeping this Unverified.","The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com. Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times. And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous. For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido. But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers. Scroll down for video Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known. Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself. But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel. They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden. They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour. DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked. Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida. Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour. They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots. One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.' The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to. DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy 'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. 'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. 'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.' His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her. 'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.' Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry. 'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said. Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away. 'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment. But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando. She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago. Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus. The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court. Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home The 29-year-old once made risqu videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys. Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way. Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido. Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home. 'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour. Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets. But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret. The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012. They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity. The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views. Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million. The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded. One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views. The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.

With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos. Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid. Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed. Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned. The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m. They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice. Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'. The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features. The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting. A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them. The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes. Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'. He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'. Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.' Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.

Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013. DeJesus' name does not appear on the records. Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006. She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986. On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.

In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos. It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?' Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park. Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years. The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive. One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house. 'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.' Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.' Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home. Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos. Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home. Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced. Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography",Brazilian EX-porn star Diane DeJesus is figure behind YouTube'S DC Toys Collector
3,Unverified,"A video posted on YouTube, and then shared on Reddit, claims to show that the TBS reruns are 7.5% faster than normal.","On Feb. 15 Reddit user Electrorocket posted a link to a YouTube video that allegedly compares the speed of a regular Seinfeld episode with one broadcast on TBS. The video has been online since Sept. 2013, but the post on Reddit (reddit.com/r/television/comments/2vwgk9/tbs_speeds_up_seinfeld_75_to_gain_an_extra_2) attracted new interest and media coverage. The video was also posted to AVSForum.com around the same time, with more details from the user. As of now, it's not clear whether the claim is true, though it has been confirmed that other stations speed up reruns. We will seek confirmation from TBS.","Quote: Aleron Ives The nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Originally Posted byThe nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Quote: As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb. Quote: Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate. Yes - I think because 24fps film content that has been telecined to video in the US has 3:2 pull-down that is introduced by the telecine, the addition of 3:2 pulldown (the pulldown refers to the physical act of pulling down the film during blanking on early telecines which didn't employ continuous scanning) has become intertwined with the telecine process. However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection.",TBS speeds up Seinfeld a full 7.5 percent - here is the proof - AVS Forum

Jess was selected to overlook Teletubbyland as Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po had fun below. Her decision to come out and 'say hello' came after her first week at Canterbury Christ Church university, when students were told to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN. The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision. ""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.

""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement. The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday. ""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""

1,FALSE,Reports suggest it is his second wife and their 8 year-old son. Some have claimed she is actually an ex-wife. Note: This claim originally said the woman was detained along with his son. Lebanon now claims it is his daughter. We changed the text to reflect that.,"The claim originated with unnamed sources connected to the Lebanese Army, as well as unnamed ""Lebanese security officials"" and a ""a senior political source."" However, after the claim was made, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official spoke on the record say the woman is not one of the ISIS leader's wives. Update Dec. 5: Lebanon says DNA tests prove that she is an ex-wife and one of her children is his. We are holding this as unverified until more details emerge from the government.","Arrest is described as high-value catch and reportedly follows information provided by western intelligence agencies The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border. The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight. Lebanese security officials described the woman as a high-value catch and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadis DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004. The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports. Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian. It is close to impossible that she would have operational details, said an Iraqi intelligence officer. But she could still be useful on things like locations. Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraqs north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britains GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (6.4m) bounty on Baghdadis head. Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanons military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut. The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time. The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border. Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraqs central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew. Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month. The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The videos authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants. Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name. If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia. The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom. In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that the Dane is doing better. Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria.",Wife and child of Islamic State leader Baghdadi held in Lebanon
1,FALSE,Rosenberg is a Canadian-born woman who previously spent time in the Israeli Army and recently said she had joined Kurdish forces.,"This claim was first made on websites and forums that are connected to Islamic State, and was then piked up by Israeli media, including the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz. No evidence has emerged to back up her alleged capture. The Jerusalem Post contacted Shin Bet, Israel's security service, and was told ""there are no further details at this stage."" An article posted on LiveLeak (see below) claims that Kurdish forces have denied her capture, but that has not been corroborated.","Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was reportedly captured by Islamic State. Islamist websites  some of them known to be close to, or even serving as a front for, the terrorist organization  reported Sunday that the 31-year-old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas. According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured  or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli  of dual nationality  in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism  in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

The masked executioner with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the groups leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday. The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets. Scroll down for video The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them, a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday. This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman added: We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We dont have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports. The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports. A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons. The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured. Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. But until now, Jihadi Johns presence at the meeting has not emerged. It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present. The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present. Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was the one who slaughtered the journalists. It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosques loudspeakers, appealing for the towns residents to donate blood at the hospital. Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes. The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regimes 17th Division and 93rd Brigade. Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal Jihadi John has become one of the worlds most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker. British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS. Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group. Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS wilayat, or province. IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike. Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq. He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria. The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards. In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed. Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturdays attack. The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leaders house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property. It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim. He said: A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes. The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria. It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured. Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.",Got him!

1,FALSE,The country's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice allegedly implemented this.,"In late October Syrian ""news agency"" AINA plagiarized and published as new this 2011 report from the Daily Beast: thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/11/19/saudi-arabia-s-religious-police-outlaw-tempting-eyes.html. That was then picked up by Opposing Views, Metro UK and others who wrote it up as new. It also spread to Swedish media. This caught the attention of the Viral Reviewer team at Metro Sweden, who have debunked the reports.","I love the looks of you, the lure of youThe sweet of you, and the pure of youThe eyes, the arms, and the mouth of youThe east, west, north, and the south of you Cole Porter Its a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabias religious police, isnt a fan of Cole Porter. The lure of you is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any womens eyes that are deemed tempting. The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones he said. [We] have the right to do so. What are tempting eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble. The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means having an appeal. What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is arousing a sympathetic response. And what is sympathetic? Showing empathy, according to Merriam-Webster. So there you have it. To allow a womens eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious policemassively funded by King Abdullahcannot do this. Its so stupid, the Saudi journalist tells me. I dont know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They wont be silent. Perhaps they wont be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee. No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March. How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator. If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it tempting to stop treating women as property.",Saudi Arabia's Religious Police Outlaw 'Tempting Eyes'
3,Unverified,"The channel has racked up more than 2.8 billion views, but the identity of woman in the videos has always been a mystery.","The Daily Mail published a story on Feb 24 that said the woman in the videos used to do porn under the name Sandy Summers. It alleges that she is a Brazilian who now lives in Orlando and goes by the name Daiane DeJesus. The story cites anonymous former neighbors who it says confirmed that it is DeJesus' voice on the videos, and that she was a porn actor. It also reported that the ex-wife of DeJesus's partner confirmed that the couple is behind the YouTube account. Due to the abundance of anonymous sources and the lack of definitive proof that DeJesus is the woman in the videos, and that she was a porn star, we are keeping this Unverified.","The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com. Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times. And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous. For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido. But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers. Scroll down for video Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known. Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself. But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records. Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel. They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden. They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour. DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked. Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida. Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour. They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots. One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.' The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to. DeJesus and her partner Messias Credido's old home in Winter Park, Orlando, where porn films featuring DeJesus as Sandy Summers and some of what were known as the Disney Collector videos were both made The DC Toys Collector formula is simple, with the woman simply removing the toys from their packaging, demonstrating each part and sometimes assembling them for the benefit of her massive online audience The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen This still is from the channel's most successful video, which has been viewed more than 200million times DeJesus' career change means neighbours say she is now the figure behind the most lucrative account on YouTube The user unboxes everything from Disney princesses to tubs of Play-Doh, including this Cars themed toy 'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange. 'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on. 'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.' His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her. 'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.' Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry. 'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said. Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away. 'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment. But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando. She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago. Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus. The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court. Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home The 29-year-old once made risqu videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys. Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way. Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido. Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home. 'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour. Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets. But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret. The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012. They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity. The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views. Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million. The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded. One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views. The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video posts Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site. With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos. Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid. Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed. Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned. The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m. They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice. Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'. The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features. The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting. A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them. The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes. Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'. He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'. Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.' Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'. The pool and backyard area at the Winter Park house, where Sandy Summers made some of her videos according to neighbours The entrance to the gated community where DeJesus lives and is thought to make her wildly popular toy review videos DeJesus has been able to move to the exclusive area apparently thanks to DC Toys Collector making $5m a year Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, close to where DC Toys Collector has its headquarters But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando. Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013. DeJesus' name does not appear on the records. Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy. According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006. She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986. On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place. 'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely! 'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.' In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos. It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?' Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park. Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale. DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years. The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive. One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house. 'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.' Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.' Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home. Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos. Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home. Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced. Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography",Brazilian EX-porn star Diane DeJesus is figure behind YouTube'S DC Toys Collector
3,Unverified,"A video posted on YouTube, and then shared on Reddit, claims to show that the TBS reruns are 7.5% faster than normal.","On Feb. 15 Reddit user Electrorocket posted a link to a YouTube video that allegedly compares the speed of a regular Seinfeld episode with one broadcast on TBS. The video has been online since Sept. 2013, but the post on Reddit (reddit.com/r/television/comments/2vwgk9/tbs_speeds_up_seinfeld_75_to_gain_an_extra_2) attracted new interest and media coverage. The video was also posted to AVSForum.com around the same time, with more details from the user. As of now, it's not clear whether the claim is true, though it has been confirmed that other stations speed up reruns. We will seek confirmation from TBS.","Quote: Aleron Ives The nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Originally Posted byThe nomenclature seems to have developed around the concept of IVTC filters, since the general ""best practise"" technique in computer circles is to undo any field or frame repetition in order to restore the original progressive frames in any video. Quote: As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb. Quote: Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate. Yes - I think because 24fps film content that has been telecined to video in the US has 3:2 pull-down that is introduced by the telecine, the addition of 3:2 pulldown (the pulldown refers to the physical act of pulling down the film during blanking on early telecines which didn't employ continuous scanning) has become intertwined with the telecine process. However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection.",TBS speeds up Seinfeld a full 7.5 percent - here is the proof - AVS Forum

The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN. The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision. ""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face.

""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement. The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday. ""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""

3,Unverified,Apple will acquire social networking app Path.,"A report by PandoDaily, which cites ""a single well-placed source inside Appleâ€™s engineering team.""","In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social. According to a single well-placed source inside Apples engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, Its almost done, if not signed already, but its essentially a done deal. If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers  particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color. According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebooks $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, its unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. Its certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but its unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr  Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnt have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Dont be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status. Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back.

3,Unverified,It's alleged he is the ISIS fighter featured in several beheading videos.,"The Washington Post reported that the English-speaking ISIS executioner is ""Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming."" It cites unnamed friends of Emwazi, who told the post that the voice in the video belongs to their former friend. The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.) The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the ""story was confirmed by a senior British security official,"" but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct. We do not mark claims as True based on anonymous sources. The U.S. National Security Council later issued a statement saying, ""We will not comment on ongoing investigations and therefore are not in a position to confirm or deny the identity of this individual.""","This recent footage of ""Jihadi John"" shows his role in the barbaric actions of the Islamic State. (The Washington Post) The world knows him as Jihadi John, the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. [View: The atrocities of the Islamic State] I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John, said one of Emwazis close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him. A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. There was an extremely strong resemblance, Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said when shown one of the videos and asked to confirm whether Emwazi could be Jihadi John. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person, Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September  only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley  that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleys killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. [Read: The Islamic State is failing at being a state] In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues. ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazis family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. [Archives: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings] He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Foreign policy reporter Adam Goldman explains who Mohammed Emwazi is and how The Washington Post discovered his identity. (Gillian Brockell and Alice Li/The Washington Post) Emwazi and two friends  a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib  never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Its unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britains domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. [Read: Reaction to an identity revealed] Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. Emwazi attened the University of Westminster, where he studied computer programming. (Toby Melville/Reuters) The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated, Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again  this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. [Read: A Brooklyn mothers struggle to keep her son from Islamic State] I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait. Mohammed Emwazi, who grew up in west London, is believed to have lived in this house before he left for Syria. (Andy Rain/EPA) Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!! In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation, Qureshi said. In the end, he felt actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions. [Read: Key takeaways of Emwazis path to extremism] Close friends of Emwazis also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Its unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere, one of the friends said. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Its unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility the box. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed George. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. [The Islamic State caliphate is in danger of losing its main supply route] Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. He was the most deliberate, a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic States de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. I was wondering if you could send me your number, he wrote. Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.

To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, Its almost done, if not signed already, but its essentially a done deal. If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers  particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color. According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebooks $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, its unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. Its certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but its unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr  Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnt have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Dont be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status. Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back. Update 9/10/14: Morin goes back on transparency pledge, refuses to confirm or deny report that Apple is buying Path",Source: Apple set to acquire Path in an attempt to bolster iOS social cred

3,Unverified,It's alleged he is the ISIS fighter featured in several beheading videos.,"The Washington Post reported that the English-speaking ISIS executioner is ""Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming."" It cites unnamed friends of Emwazi, who told the post that the voice in the video belongs to their former friend. The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.) The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the ""story was confirmed by a senior British security official,"" but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct. We do not mark claims as True based on anonymous sources. The U.S. National Security Council later issued a statement saying, ""We will not comment on ongoing investigations and therefore are not in a position to confirm or deny the identity of this individual.""","This recent footage of ""Jihadi John"" shows his role in the barbaric actions of the Islamic State. (The Washington Post) The world knows him as Jihadi John, the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. [View: The atrocities of the Islamic State] I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John, said one of Emwazis close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him. A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. There was an extremely strong resemblance, Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said when shown one of the videos and asked to confirm whether Emwazi could be Jihadi John. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person, Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September  only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley  that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleys killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. [Read: The Islamic State is failing at being a state] In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues. ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazis family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. [Archives: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings] He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Foreign policy reporter Adam Goldman explains who Mohammed Emwazi is and how The Washington Post discovered his identity. (Gillian Brockell and Alice Li/The Washington Post) Emwazi and two friends  a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib  never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Its unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britains domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. [Read: Reaction to an identity revealed] Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. Emwazi attened the University of Westminster, where he studied computer programming. (Toby Melville/Reuters) The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated, Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again  this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. [Read: A Brooklyn mothers struggle to keep her son from Islamic State] I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait. Mohammed Emwazi, who grew up in west London, is believed to have lived in this house before he left for Syria. (Andy Rain/EPA) Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!! In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation, Qureshi said. In the end, he felt actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions. [Read: Key takeaways of Emwazis path to extremism] Close friends of Emwazis also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Its unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere, one of the friends said. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Its unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility the box. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed George. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. [The Islamic State caliphate is in danger of losing its main supply route] Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. He was the most deliberate, a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic States de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. I was wondering if you could send me your number, he wrote. Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.
