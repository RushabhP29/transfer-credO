Lebanon now claims it is his daughter. We changed the text to reflect that.,"The claim originated with unnamed sources connected to the Lebanese Army, as well as unnamed ""Lebanese security officials"" and a ""a senior political source."" However, after the claim was made, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official spoke on the record say the woman is not one of the ISIS leader's wives. Update Dec. 5: Lebanon says DNA tests prove that she is an ex-wife and one of her children is his. We are holding this as unverified until more details emerge from the government.","Arrest is described as high-value catch and reportedly follows information provided by western intelligence agencies The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border. The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight. Lebanese security officials described the woman as a high-value catch and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadis DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004. The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports. Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian. It is close to impossible that she would have operational details, said an Iraqi intelligence officer. But she could still be useful on things like locations. Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraqs north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britains GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (6.4m) bounty on Baghdadis head. Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanons military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut. The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time. The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border. Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraqs central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew. Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month. The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The videos authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants. Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name. If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia. The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom. In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that the Dane is doing better. Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria.",Wife and child of Islamic State leader Baghdadi held in Lebanon
1,FALSE,Rosenberg is a Canadian-born woman who previously spent time in the Israeli Army and recently said she had joined Kurdish forces.,"This claim was first made on websites and forums that are connected to Islamic State, and was then piked up by Israeli media, including the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz. No evidence has emerged to back up her alleged capture. The Jerusalem Post contacted Shin Bet, Israel's security service, and was told ""there are no further details at this stage."" An article posted on LiveLeak (see below) claims that Kurdish forces have denied her capture, but that has not been corroborated.","Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was reportedly captured by Islamic State. Islamist websites  some of them known to be close to, or even serving as a front for, the terrorist organization  reported Sunday that the 31-year-old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas. According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergs capture are probably the terrorists propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that there are no further details at this stage.Rosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to someone else and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websites reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured  or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli  of dual nationality  in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergs first tryst with adventurism  in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

1,FALSE,It has also been claimed that he was the ISIS fighter speaking English in recent beheadings videos.,"It was first reported by the Mail on Sunday, citing ""reports received by the Foreign Office."" ","Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office. The masked executioner with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the groups leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday. The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets. Scroll down for video The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them, a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday. This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq. The Foreign Office spokesman added: We have a number of sources of information coming in. The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We dont have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports. The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports. A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons. The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured. Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. But until now, Jihadi Johns presence at the meeting has not emerged. It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present. The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present. Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was the one who slaughtered the journalists. It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment. IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosques loudspeakers, appealing for the towns residents to donate blood at the hospital. Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes. The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regimes 17th Division and 93rd Brigade. Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal Jihadi John has become one of the worlds most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker. British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS. Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group. Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS wilayat, or province. IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike. Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq. He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria. The raid is believed to have injured the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards. In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed. Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturdays attack. The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leaders house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property. It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim. He said: A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes. The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria. It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured. Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.",Got him!

That was then picked up by Opposing Views, Metro UK and others who wrote it up as new. It also spread to Swedish media. This caught the attention of the Viral Reviewer team at Metro Sweden, who have debunked the reports.","I love the looks of you, the lure of youThe sweet of you, and the pure of youThe eyes, the arms, and the mouth of youThe east, west, north, and the south of you Cole Porter Its a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabias religious police, isnt a fan of Cole Porter. The lure of you is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any womens eyes that are deemed tempting. The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones he said. [We] have the right to do so. What are tempting eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble. The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means having an appeal. What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is arousing a sympathetic response. And what is sympathetic? Showing empathy, according to Merriam-Webster. So there you have it. To allow a womens eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious policemassively funded by King Abdullahcannot do this. Its so stupid, the Saudi journalist tells me. I dont know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They wont be silent. Perhaps they wont be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee. No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March. How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

1,FALSE,Reports also claim this will lead to the release of the kidnapped girls.,"The news emerged on Oct. 17 in statements from the Nigerian government. Boko Haram did not immediately confirm the ceasefire, or the related release of the girls.","Nigerias government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago. Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms. Part of the deal includes the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the presidents national information centre. There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps. From the discussions, [Boko Harams representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues, Mr Omeri said. They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well. The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girls abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion. Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigerias neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks. There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigerias coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year. Hes having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost, the diplomat said. Its the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better. But weve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, were taking this with a little salt. Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious. This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we arent there yet, said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. Until every girl is released negotiations must continue. We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce. Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls. Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians reactions to the kidnap crisis. The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release. Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the groups senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal. The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria. It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaedas franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians. Boko Harams leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigerias volatile Middle Belt, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet. The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return. Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons. The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok. The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram. Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.","Nigeria's missing girls 'to be released by Boko Haram', government aide claims"
1,FALSE,Reports claim that former Iraqi Army pilots are teaching ISIS how to fly the Syrian jets.,"The report came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.","BEIRUT  - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air. The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria. U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes. They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein, Abdulrahman said. People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back, he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border. Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report. It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military. U.S. MILITARY KEEPING CLOSE EYE Were not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere, U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State. We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be. General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. militarys Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. We dont have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I dont have any information on that either, he told a Pentagon news briefing. Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats. The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes. There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people. Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising. He told The Independent: Isis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them.

1,FALSE,He reportedly needs 100 days to recover from an injury suffered while training with generals.,"Reuters first reported it on Oct. 9, citing ""a source with access to the secretive North's leadership.""","BEIJING/SEOUL  - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive Norths leadership said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-olds health and grip on power. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (4th R) visits the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to pay tribute to founding President Kim Il Sung and former leader Kim Jong Il to mark the 61st anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War, in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 27, 2014. REUTERS/KCNA North Koreas state media, which usually chronicles Kims whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3, and Kim was absent from early state media coverage of a major political anniversary on Friday. In the previous two years, Kim marked the anniversary of the founding of North Koreas Workers Party with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred. Last year, that visit was covered about four hours later by the states KCNA news agency, and by the daily Rodong Sinmun newspaper. As of about 8 a.m. (7.00 p.m. EDT) on Friday, there was no KCNA report of an event at the mausoleum. Fridays Rodong Sinmun could not yet be seen on its website. Kims father, Kim Jong Il, did not always attend the Oct. 10 memorial event when he was in power. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said on Thursday that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises. He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened, the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with important officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified. Kim Jong Un is in total control, said the source. Kims absence from public view is fuelling speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle. The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow, said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. NOT KIMS FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kims public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view. In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium. Speculation that Kims unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean television report late last month that said he was suffering from discomfort. Some North Korea watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Uns health said rumors of a coup were rubbish. It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans, said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kims sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme Peoples Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago. However, Kims name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Thursdays edition of the Rodong Sinmun carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked the Marshal for his support during the competition. Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped. Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing, he said.","North Korea leader Kim is still in charge, has leg injury: source"
1,FALSE,U.S. Border Patrol allegedly caught the men.,"it was made by U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, while on Fox News on Oct. 7.","A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico."" Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."" He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim. ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol."" ""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism."" Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh. The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told. Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border."" At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border. Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group."" The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland. He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas. Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""

1,FALSE,James Foley's parents claim that US officials threatened to prosecute them if they raised ransom in an attempt to free their son.,Interview with Diane Foley on ABC News on 9/12/14,"The mother of slain American journalist James Foley said she wasnt necessarily surprised that the U.S. government threatened her family with prosecution should they raise money to pay her sons ransom, but she was astounded by how such a devastating message was delivered. I was surprised there was so little compassion, Diane Foley told ABC News today of the three separate warnings she said U.S. officials gave the family about the illegality of paying ransom to the terror group ISIS. It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted Im sure [the U.S. official] didnt mean it the way he said it, but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day. Earlier this week five current and former officials with direct knowledge of the Foley case confirmed the alleged threats were made. ""It was an utterly idiotic thing to do that came across as if [the U.S. official] had the compassion of an anvil,"" said a former official who has advised the family. Digital Feature: Inside Terrorist Hostage Negotiations Could Money Have Saved James Foley? Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James Foley Nicole Tung/AP Photo Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foleys brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official. It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust that the way they were handling things would bring our son home, Diane Foley said. The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant. Digital Globe Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didnt seem like anything was being done. But were not politicians, were not government people, we dont know, she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family had no idea because the government didnt tell them. At times, Diane Foley said the family had to beg the government for information on their son. We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level They didnt have time for us, she said. Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters hes not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family. It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations, Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foleys situation to the Justice Department. Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was really taken aback [and] surprised by Foleys allegations. I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements, Kerry said. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists. But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening, Harf said. Obtained by ABC News Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment. ""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement. The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price. Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded. ""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said. The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government. Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity. Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?"" ""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said. In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. governments treatment of the families of hostages, As Americans, we can do better.

It has over time garnered a large number of shares and has spread to other languages. ,"Madrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction. This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January. The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death. Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate. The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital. The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola. They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life. At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Prez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat. A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies. However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing. The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed. The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials. The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.",Doctors Confirm First Human Death Officially Caused by GMOs
1,FALSE,The real American lunch in the photo essay was replaced with a photo that is decidedly less appetizing.,"The Daily Mail UK first published the photo essay on Feb. 18 with the paltry American meal swapped-in, suggesting ""Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.""","The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be giving kids enough to eat However, students in the world's richest nation lunches are the unhealthiest with lots of processed items Korean schools serve hearty fish soup and fermented cabbage, kimchi while Greece, Spain and France all serve fresh meat, vegetables and fish Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky. Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll. The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough. What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years. In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly. Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently. Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David, Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu  truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'. Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page. Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America. The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren. While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items. Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

1,FALSE,"The accused is Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, an Indian spiritual guru and movie-star.","The story emerged in late December 2014 when Justice K Kannan of the High Court ordered India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate a petition filed by Hans Raj Chauha, who was a follower of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Chauha's filing claimed that roughly 400 other followers were forcibly castrated inside an ashram. In late Feb., the Sydney Morning Herald reported on the case, setting off a cascade of reports in Western media. This claim is Unverified until the accusations are proven in court.","Days after the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the mass castration of full-time followers of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the petitioner in the case has revealed the castrations were done to safeguard sadhvis (female full-time followers) from possible sexual advances. Hans Raj, the petitioner, told Hindustan Times, The culture of initiating female devotees as full-timers was started by Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and he was concerned about possible sexual advances by male full-timers (sadhus). Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemies. Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chiefs religious programmes. Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chiefs power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012. The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. Castrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own, he said. While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana polices investigation was worthless. Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago. He said the controversies were the handiwork of drug mafia who were up in arms against them.",Dera Sacha Sauda chief faces castration charges
1,FALSE,Yet another death Hoax.,The hoax website MSMBC.co published an article that reported Nelson had died.,"Legendary country music star Willie Nelson was found dead today in his Maui home. He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelsons death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police. A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelsons property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911. There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play, said Det. Aldeson. Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks, said County Coroner Frank Shultz.

1,FALSE,"This hoax tale spread to a number of places, but it originated on a fake news website.","The story first appeared on Feb. 4 on the fake news website World News Daily report. From there, it spread to legitimate sites, including a CBS radio station in Texas, Metro UK, and sites in Africa, India and France.","Boston | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal ONeal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure. The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered. The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light. He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like Being of Light. Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting states the Catholic priest. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mothers embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesnt disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more! The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors. Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father ONeal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the Holy Mother. I wish to continue preaching says the elderly cleric. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father ONeal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.",Catholic Priest Who Died for 48 Minutes Claims That God Is A Woman

The situation caused a fight between the two families.","The Times of India was the first outlet to report the incident. Its story attributed the claim to a spokesperson from the Milak police station, RP Solanki, who said that the groom and his family were upset and initially lodged a complaint with the police. The BBC followed up and quoted ""local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki"" as saying that the claim was later withdrawn. None of the families have been quoted. Also, the alleged bride's full name is missing from the original story. She is only referred to as ""Indira from Rampur,"" though others have their full names.

That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishores medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh.

1,FALSE,Afton Elaine Burton allegedly wanted to display Manson's body in order to profit from it.,"The claim appeared in a New York Post article on Feb. 8. It was attributed to journalist Daniel Simone, who is working on a book about Manson. The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a ""bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb"" in order to ""draw huge crowds and make big money."" (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project. This is Unverified until evidence emerges either way.","This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson. Mansons engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book. Mansons fiance, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone. Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Mansons remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenins Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money. But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. Hes finally realized that hes been played for a fool, Simone said. Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. He feels he will never die, Simone said. Therefore, he feels its a stupid idea to begin with. Mansons and Burtons marriage license expired Thursday. They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months, says a statement posted on Burtons and Hammonds website. Burton and Hammond  who uses the nickname Gray Wolf  could not be reached for comment. The wedding was postponed due to an unexpected interruption in logistics, the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said. California prison officials would not comment on either Mansons medical condition or his whereabouts. Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, The Retrial of Charles Manson. Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail. According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Mansons corpse about two years ago. Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies. He didnt give them a yes, he didnt give them a no. He sort of strung them along, Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said. When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says. If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Mansons remains upon his death, Simone said. Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will, he said. Another Simone book, The Lufthansa Heist, about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with GoodFellas mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.",Charles Mansons fiance wanted to marry him for his corpse: source

He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as Zombie Cat but to us hes always been nothing short of a miracle.

Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt! UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, dont you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes. UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer. UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff. UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didnt budge from the bed or offer to share, but well give it some time! Were just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again! UPDATE! February 25, 2015 Its been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to oh I get what Im supposed to do to SUCCESS!. UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We dont have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffers laps after eating his lunch. UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug. We know there are questions about Barts situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can. QUESTION 1 Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law. QUESTION 2 Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances: Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination Requirement Sec. 6-22 Registration & License tags Requirement Sec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat Identification Sec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of Animals Sec. 6-26 Cruelty to Animals Sec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at Large QUESTION 3 Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to line their pockets (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No ones pockets are being lined. Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Barts story has gone into a restricted fund called Save-A-Pet Medical Fund to pay for Barts medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need. In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. QUESTION 4 When will the issue of Barts custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined. QUESTION 5 How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to _EMAIL_ and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals. UPDATE! February 11, 2015 On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societys animal hospital. UPDATE! February 6, 2015 We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence. UPDATE! February 4, 2015 We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed. UPDATE! January 30, 2105 New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Barts home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life. The Humane Society of Tampa Bays Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Barts medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Barts medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Barts future. As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy! UPDATE! January 27, 2015 Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today. We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention. The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home.

1,FALSE,"The woman is allegedly a cloistered nun from South America living in Macerata, Italy. She complained of stomach pains and supposedly gave birth when taken to a hospital.","This was originally reported by Italian newspaper Corriere Adriatico on Jan. 22.

The paper added that ""the sisters did not want to add anything else, without explaining even if the woman has or has not taken vows.""

Appunto lamentava dolori di pancia ma lecografia ha svelato il mistero e il medico di turno ha invitato suora e consorelle a prendere subito la strada del reparto di ostetricia non senza un attimo di imbarazzo. Sacco amniotico rotto e equipe subito in azione per far partorire la suora.Della storia, ovviamente, si sa ben poco anche se la stessa ci ha messo un nulla a fare il giro del paese e a uscire allo scoperto non solo dall'ovattato silenzio assicurato da personale medico e infermieristico che ha assistito al lieto evento ma anche da quello, pi religioso in questo caso, del convento che sembrerebbe essere addirittura un monastero di clausura della zona (a San Severino ce ne sono due, il convento di S.Caterina e quello di S.Chiara, entrambi nella zona del Catsello). Nulla trapela, ovviamente, sulla identit della religiosa, n sui tratti somatici del pargolo. Mistero sul fatto se somigli pi alla mamma piuttosto che al pap.E non chiedete se a venire al mondo sia stato un maschietto o una femminuccia visto che in corsia gli imbarazzi sono palpabili. Si sa solo che la mamma del nascituro, originaria di uno stato del sud America, sarebbe arrivata nel Maceratese da qualche tempo e avrebbe trovato alloggio, forse rifugio, in una struttura di clausura della nostra provincia.Difficile anche poter dire se la suora abbia o meno confessato il suo peccato, non certo veniale, alla sua superiora. Si sa per che la religiosa sarebbe arrivata prima al pronto soccorso, e successivamente sarebbe stata fatta salire in reparto, accompagnata da altre consorelle che, ancor prima di gridare al miracolo, avrebbero affidato alle preghiera del Signore chi nel frattempo stava per venire alla luce.L'ingresso all'accettazione  avvenuto domenica ed  stato, comunque, un gran giorno di festa per l'arrivo di una nuova vita. Cos, nell'imbarazzo veramente generale, sono state seguite dall'equipe che ha eseguito il parto le concitate fasi che hanno accompagnato lo stesso.Niente fiori all'ingresso della cameretta che in questi giorni ha permesso di garantire l'anonimato alla neo mamma che, comunque, sembra aver deciso di tenere il piccolo e che forse ora sar trasferita altrove, probabilmente in una casa famiglia.Di certo prima di domenica la suora non si sarebbe sottoposta a controlli, questo  quello che avrebbero raccontato le religiose che con lei hanno condiviso la clausura negli ultimi mesi. E di certo nella struttura che la ospitava, la suora difficilmente avrebbe potuto aver avuto contatti con il mondo esterno. Anche se le vie del Signore, si sa, sono veramente infinite.Non stup, mesi fa, la notizia del parto di un'altra suora, stavolta congolese. Il bimbo venuto alla luce fu dapprima affidato a una coppia di Tolentino e poi tolto ai genitori adottivi con un provvedimento inatteso e inaspettato della Suprema Corte per finire affidato a una casa d'accoglienza.In quel caso la mamma naturale aveva abbandonato la pargoletta alla nascita.

1,FALSE,More than 200 real estate agents pooled the tip together at an annual conference. They gave it to the driver with a VISA gift card and lottery tickets.,The claim was first reported in the Detroit Free Press on Jan. 16. ,"A pizza delivery guy named Rob is presented with a huge tip by realtors. (Photo: Screen capture from YouTube video) It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip. But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday. Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor. ""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk."" LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone. A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years. When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy. ""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away."" LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip. ""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated."" Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation. ""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this."" McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment. ""He was a little stunned,"" she said. ""Everyone was excited and you could kind of feel the energy in the room.

1,FALSE,"A fake news website created a hoax about Tsarnaev, saying he was blinded and paralyzed from an attack.","Fake news website Empire News published the claim Jan. 17, saying white supremacists were behind the attack on Tsarnaev. ","0 FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts  Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson. Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby. It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere  all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma, said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev. Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber, said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us Thank you. Well, Youre welcome. Youre welcome, Boston. Youre welcome, America! Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence, said warden Jacobson. Because of the nature of Tsarnaevs crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed. 0 Comments comments","Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again"
1,FALSE,It's a hoax from a fake news website.,Fake news website World News Daily Report first published the claim online on Jan. 14.,"Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perths King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record-breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning. The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman. The single mother whos delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mothers abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mothers health and was undergone without any complications.

The company said those affected should seek compensation from the vehicle manufacturer.

Police said the contents of the truck had mainly been from local sewers, but it also emptied septic tanks from public toilets from time to time. Spokesman Cai Chin said: 'No-one suffered physical harm, but many of those covered sought medical attention for fear that chemicals used in the cleaning process, or indeed diseases from the sludge, could cause harm to those affected by the blast.'",Shoppers covered in poo after septic tanker explodes over Chinese street
3,Unverified,A California man says that Comcast got him fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers after he complained about poor service and incorrect charges.,It was first reported by Consumerist on Oct. 6 in a report that identified the man by his first name. A follow up from Ars Technica on Oct. 7 named him as Conal O'Rourke.,"UPDATE #3: Conal has filed a lawsuit against the cable giant in a federal court in California, alleging that  among other claims  Comcast violated a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing customers information without their consent.  UPDATE #2: Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.  UPDATE: Conals former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment. - When you complain to your cable company, you certainly dont expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But thats exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm. TL;DR Version  Customer spends 11 months being overcharged by Comcast. Customers complaints go unresolved.  Customer contacts office of Comcasts Controller to complain about billing practices.  Comcast contacts customers employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employers name during complaint.  Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.  Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customers claim that he didnt use the name of his employer. IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conals last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse. A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conals monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have. Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered. CUTTING THE CORD He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation. But things didnt just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didnt order. There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with, he says. Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff hed never requested and had no use for. When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nations most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer. He says even this didnt convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasnt yet past due, Comcast sent Conals account into collections in Feb. 2014. THE CALL IN QUESTION And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcasts customer service, which hadnt been of any help in the year hed been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the companys Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. He describes that callback as bizarre, with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with How can I help you? Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldnt specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house. So he tried the Controllers office again, to let them know that the rep theyd sent his way had failed miserably at her job. During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcasts billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given. But something did happen. Just not anything good. WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast. At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conals subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says hed only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controllers office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. When he was fired, Conals employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether its accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter. And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcasts books. So Conal doesnt quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage. In response to a letter from Conals lawyer  he has not filed a lawsuit, but its not out of the question  Comcasts Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conals employer but says that Conal is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn about his dispute with Comcast. THE HEART OF THE MATTER I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controllers office. Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldnt have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service hed paid for. Im also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call. How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like Im a lawyer or Im a big shot at [fill in the blank]? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customers employer? We reached out to Comcast to ask whether its company policy to contact customers employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement. Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us, reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds we will review his lawyers letter and respond as quickly as possible.","Unhappy Customer: Comcast Told My Employer About Complaint, Got Me Fired"

3,Unverified,"Following its acquisition of Beats, Apple is reportedly going to shutdown the Beats streaming music service.","TechCrunch reported it, citing ""several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.""","Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. Its not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dres music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand. [Update: Apple has told TechCrunch that our report of Beats being shut down is not true, but sources familiar with the situation tell Re/code that Apple may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand. This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that its unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being shuttered, but thats semantics. Apples response really depends on the interpretation of shut down. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a rebranding aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. Well see what happens if and when Apple adds streaming to iTunes, but its doubtful that Apple will maintain Beats Music as its own brand and independent product.] The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps came loaded on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the services radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was being advertised to new users on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there. Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a unannounced music app [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo. Considering Apples penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Musics CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning hes already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music. Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was mostly about getting Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dres talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. Weve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. [Update: Response in update above.] Beats has recently launched an Apple TV channel and released a Listen Now integration with Shazam, but both seem like they could have been in the pipeline directly. One Beats Music employee told me some teams on the non-technical side have been told to keep up business as usual. The move will let Apple focus on its flagship music product with its enormous 800 million user base and treasure trove of over 400 million stored credit cards. Beats Musics growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&T, 5 million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. Thats pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and 76.4 million active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didnt hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it. The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand. One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year. Apple is in the tricky position of trying to smoothly transition its music business from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With streaming eating downloads, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesnt just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing vital capital to the music industry. Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. Its doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.

3,Unverified,Apple will acquire social networking app Path.,"A report by PandoDaily, which cites ""a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team.""","In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social. According to a single well-placed source inside Apples engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, Its almost done, if not signed already, but its essentially a done deal. If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers  particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color. According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebooks $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, its unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. Its certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but its unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr  Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnt have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Dont be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status. Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back.

3,Unverified,It's alleged he is the ISIS fighter featured in several beheading videos.,"The Washington Post reported that the English-speaking ISIS executioner is ""Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming."" It cites unnamed friends of Emwazi, who told the post that the voice in the video belongs to their former friend. The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.) The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the ""story was confirmed by a senior British security official,"" but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct. We do not mark claims as True based on anonymous sources. The U.S. National Security Council later issued a statement saying, ""We will not comment on ongoing investigations and therefore are not in a position to confirm or deny the identity of this individual.""","This recent footage of ""Jihadi John"" shows his role in the barbaric actions of the Islamic State. (The Washington Post) The world knows him as Jihadi John, the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. [View: The atrocities of the Islamic State] I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John, said one of Emwazis close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him. A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. There was an extremely strong resemblance, Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said when shown one of the videos and asked to confirm whether Emwazi could be Jihadi John. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person, Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September  only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley  that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleys killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. [Read: The Islamic State is failing at being a state] In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues. ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazis family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. [Archives: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings] He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Foreign policy reporter Adam Goldman explains who Mohammed Emwazi is and how The Washington Post discovered his identity. (Gillian Brockell and Alice Li/The Washington Post) Emwazi and two friends  a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib  never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Its unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britains domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. [Read: Reaction to an identity revealed] Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. Emwazi attened the University of Westminster, where he studied computer programming. (Toby Melville/Reuters) The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated, Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again  this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

Mohammed Emwazi, who grew up in west London, is believed to have lived in this house before he left for Syria. (Andy Rain/EPA) Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!! In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation, Qureshi said. In the end, he felt actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions. [Read: Key takeaways of Emwazis path to extremism] Close friends of Emwazis also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Its unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere, one of the friends said. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Its unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility the box. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed George. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. [The Islamic State caliphate is in danger of losing its main supply route] Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. He was the most deliberate, a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic States de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. I was wondering if you could send me your number, he wrote. Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.

1,FALSE,"The bride was reportedly angry because she was unaware of her fiance's epilepsy. She then allegedly offered to marry Harpal Singh, her sister's brother-in-law, and he accepted. The situation caused a fight between the two families.","The Times of India was the first outlet to report the incident. Its story attributed the claim to a spokesperson from the Milak police station, RP Solanki, who said that the groom and his family were upset and initially lodged a complaint with the police. The BBC followed up and quoted ""local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki"" as saying that the claim was later withdrawn. None of the families have been quoted. Also, the alleged bride's full name is missing from the original story. She is only referred to as ""Indira from Rampur,"" though others have their full names.

That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishores medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife.

His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used  spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain.

Beck beat out both the nights top winner, Sam Smith, and the categorys expected winner, Beyonc.

1,FALSE,Afton Elaine Burton allegedly wanted to display Manson's body in order to profit from it.,"The claim appeared in a New York Post article on Feb. 8. It was attributed to journalist Daniel Simone, who is working on a book about Manson. The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a ""bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb"" in order to ""draw huge crowds and make big money."" (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project. This is Unverified until evidence emerges either way.","This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson. Mansons engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book. Mansons fiance, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone. Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Mansons remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Lenins Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money. But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. Hes finally realized that hes been played for a fool, Simone said. Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. He feels he will never die, Simone said. Therefore, he feels its a stupid idea to begin with. Mansons and Burtons marriage license expired Thursday. They plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months, says a statement posted on Burtons and Hammonds website. Burton and Hammond  who uses the nickname Gray Wolf  could not be reached for comment. The wedding was postponed due to an unexpected interruption in logistics, the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said. California prison officials would not comment on either Mansons medical condition or his whereabouts. Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, The Retrial of Charles Manson. Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail. According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Mansons corpse about two years ago. Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies. He didnt give them a yes, he didnt give them a no. He sort of strung them along, Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said. When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says. If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Mansons remains upon his death, Simone said. Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will, he said. Another Simone book, The Lufthansa Heist, about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with GoodFellas mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.",Charles Mansons fiance wanted to marry him for his corpse: source

1,FALSE,"Bart the cat showed up in his neighbor's yard five days after being buried. He should make a full recovery, according to the Humane Society.","The Humane Society Tampa Bay released a statement and images about the cat, and the claim was followed up with footage of the animal on the local Fox station. It quickly went viral. ","UPDATE! February 2, 2017 Here is how comfortable Bart feels in his new home: His mom purchased a soft, stuffed elephant as a Christmas present for her baby niece. Bart proceeded to pilfer through the bag, drag the elephant out, carry it to his sleeping spot and snuggle up with it for a nap. Its been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals dont dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant. UPDATE! September 14, 2016 Its Official, Bart is OURS! After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a Gotcha Day party (Gotcha Days are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world). In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as Zombie Cat but to us hes always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever. We know you havent heard from Bart in awhile, but he is still doing GREAT! In fact, he recently got visits from a couple of his fans. First, he and this special young lady really bonded when she was with us for Critter Camp. When he saw her last week he got so excited and rolled right over so that she could pet him. Second, this wonderful lady has been following his story since the beginning and came by to see how healthy and happy he has become. He was happy to show her the ropes of life at HSTB (sleep, eat, play, snuggle, repeat). And, finally, we wanted you to see how exhausting the celebrity life can be; here is Bart mid-yawn and ready for a nap after his morning of socializing UPDATE! February 23, 2016 Bart really is the sweetest thing but, every once in awhile, the cattitude comes out!

Well, he deserves it! UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, hes fantastic and happier than ever, and were still waiting on the courts to decide custody.

September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous owner so for now hes still living it up at HSTB. UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze! Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize! UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteers day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend. UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we dont have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. The little girl had so much fun, she and her mom went out and bought him a laser toy then came back to give it to him and play some more UPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and were sure shell be back to say hello. UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Barts food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory. Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart. UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. Hes an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved! UPDATE!

Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while! UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office. UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon! UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. Well keep you updated! UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We cant thank them enough! UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Barts surgeon) a signed copy of her childrens book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but thats OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt! UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, dont you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes. UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer. UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff. UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didnt budge from the bed or offer to share, but well give it some time! Were just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again! UPDATE! February 25, 2015 Its been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to oh I get what Im supposed to do to SUCCESS!. UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We dont have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffers laps after eating his lunch. UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug. We know there are questions about Barts situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can. QUESTION 1 Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law. QUESTION 2 Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances: Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination Requirement Sec. 6-22 Registration & License tags Requirement Sec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat Identification Sec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of Animals Sec. 6-26 Cruelty to Animals Sec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at Large QUESTION 3 Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to line their pockets (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No ones pockets are being lined. Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Barts story has gone into a restricted fund called Save-A-Pet Medical Fund to pay for Barts medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need. In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. QUESTION 4 When will the issue of Barts custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined. QUESTION 5 How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to _EMAIL_ and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals. UPDATE! February 11, 2015 On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societys animal hospital. UPDATE! February 6, 2015 We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence. UPDATE! February 4, 2015 We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy! UPDATE! February 2, 2015 Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed. UPDATE! January 30, 2105 New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Barts home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life. The Humane Society of Tampa Bays Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Barts medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Barts medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Barts future. As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably. UPDATE! January 28, 2015 Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy! UPDATE! January 27, 2015 Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today. We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention. The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home.

Appunto lamentava dolori di pancia ma lecografia ha svelato il mistero e il medico di turno ha invitato suora e consorelle a prendere subito la strada del reparto di ostetricia non senza un attimo di imbarazzo.

Nulla trapela, ovviamente, sulla identit della religiosa, n sui tratti somatici del pargolo. Mistero sul fatto se somigli pi alla mamma piuttosto che al pap.E non chiedete se a venire al mondo sia stato un maschietto o una femminuccia visto che in corsia gli imbarazzi sono palpabili. Si sa solo che la mamma del nascituro, originaria di uno stato del sud America, sarebbe arrivata nel Maceratese da qualche tempo e avrebbe trovato alloggio, forse rifugio, in una struttura di clausura della nostra provincia.Difficile anche poter dire se la suora abbia o meno confessato il suo peccato, non certo veniale, alla sua superiora. Si sa per che la religiosa sarebbe arrivata prima al pronto soccorso, e successivamente sarebbe stata fatta salire in reparto, accompagnata da altre consorelle che, ancor prima di gridare al miracolo, avrebbero affidato alle preghiera del Signore chi nel frattempo stava per venire alla luce.L'ingresso all'accettazione  avvenuto domenica ed  stato, comunque, un gran giorno di festa per l'arrivo di una nuova vita. Cos, nell'imbarazzo veramente generale, sono state seguite dall'equipe che ha eseguito il parto le concitate fasi che hanno accompagnato lo stesso.Niente fiori all'ingresso della cameretta che in questi giorni ha permesso di garantire l'anonimato alla neo mamma che, comunque, sembra aver deciso di tenere il piccolo e che forse ora sar trasferita altrove, probabilmente in una casa famiglia.Di certo prima di domenica la suora non si sarebbe sottoposta a controlli, questo  quello che avrebbero raccontato le religiose che con lei hanno condiviso la clausura negli ultimi mesi. E di certo nella struttura che la ospitava, la suora difficilmente avrebbe potuto aver avuto contatti con il mondo esterno. Anche se le vie del Signore, si sa, sono veramente infinite.Non stup, mesi fa, la notizia del parto di un'altra suora, stavolta congolese. Il bimbo venuto alla luce fu dapprima affidato a una coppia di Tolentino e poi tolto ai genitori adottivi con un provvedimento inatteso e inaspettato della Suprema Corte per finire affidato a una casa d'accoglienza.In quel caso la mamma naturale aveva abbandonato la pargoletta alla nascita.

1,FALSE,"A fake news website created a hoax about Tsarnaev, saying he was blinded and paralyzed from an attack.","Fake news website Empire News published the claim Jan. 17, saying white supremacists were behind the attack on Tsarnaev. ","0 FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts  Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 22, was the victim of an unfortunate accident yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson. Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby. It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere  all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma, said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev. Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber, said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us Thank you. Well, Youre welcome. Youre welcome, Boston. Youre welcome, America! Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence, said warden Jacobson. Because of the nature of Tsarnaevs crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed. 0 Comments comments","Boston Marathon Bomber Tsarnaev Severely Injured In Prison, May Never Walk Or Talk Again"

3,Unverified,A California man says that Comcast got him fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers after he complained about poor service and incorrect charges.,It was first reported by Consumerist on Oct. 6 in a report that identified the man by his first name. A follow up from Ars Technica on Oct. 7 named him as Conal O'Rourke.,"UPDATE #3: Conal has filed a lawsuit against the cable giant in a federal court in California, alleging that  among other claims  Comcast violated a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing customers information without their consent.  UPDATE #2: Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.  UPDATE: Conals former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment. - When you complain to your cable company, you certainly dont expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But thats exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm. TL;DR Version  Customer spends 11 months being overcharged by Comcast. Customers complaints go unresolved.  Customer contacts office of Comcasts Controller to complain about billing practices.  Comcast contacts customers employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employers name during complaint.  Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.  Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customers claim that he didnt use the name of his employer. IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conals last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse. A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conals monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have. Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered. CUTTING THE CORD He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation. But things didnt just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didnt order. There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with, he says. Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff hed never requested and had no use for. When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nations most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer. He says even this didnt convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasnt yet past due, Comcast sent Conals account into collections in Feb. 2014. THE CALL IN QUESTION And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcasts customer service, which hadnt been of any help in the year hed been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the companys Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. He describes that callback as bizarre, with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with How can I help you? Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldnt specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house. So he tried the Controllers office again, to let them know that the rep theyd sent his way had failed miserably at her job. During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcasts billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given. But something did happen. Just not anything good. WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast. At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conals subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says hed only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controllers office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. When he was fired, Conals employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether its accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter. And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcasts books. So Conal doesnt quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage. In response to a letter from Conals lawyer  he has not filed a lawsuit, but its not out of the question  Comcasts Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conals employer but says that Conal is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn about his dispute with Comcast. THE HEART OF THE MATTER I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controllers office. Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldnt have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service hed paid for. Im also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call. How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like Im a lawyer or Im a big shot at [fill in the blank]? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customers employer? We reached out to Comcast to ask whether its company policy to contact customers employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement. Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us, reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds we will review his lawyers letter and respond as quickly as possible.","Unhappy Customer: Comcast Told My Employer About Complaint, Got Me Fired"

3,Unverified,"Some Mac users have reported that when they select ""Reset All Settings"" in iOS 8 it deletes ""all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive.""","It was first reported by MacRumors, citing ""multiple posters on the MacRumors forums.""","Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever. It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums , using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud.In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com.

Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.",Bug in iOS 8's 'Reset All Settings' Option Also Erases iCloud Drive Documents
3,Unverified,"Following its acquisition of Beats, Apple is reportedly going to shutdown the Beats streaming music service.","TechCrunch reported it, citing ""several prominent employees at Apple and Beats.""","Apple will discontinue the streaming music service Beats Music it acquired in May, according to five sources, including several prominent employees at Apple and Beats. Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. Its not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dres music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand. [Update: Apple has told TechCrunch that our report of Beats being shut down is not true, but sources familiar with the situation tell Re/code that Apple may, however, modify [Beats Music] over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand. This aligns with what my sources said, which is that the Beats Music brand will be shut down, but that its unclear what Apple wants to do in streaming music. It seems quite possible that the Beats Music product could be rolled into iTunes rather than being shuttered, but thats semantics. Apples response really depends on the interpretation of shut down. If Apple rolls Beats Music into iTunes and removes the dedicated Beats Music app from the App Store, I would call that being shut down. Beats Music itself came from a rebranding aka shutdown of the MOG music streaming service it acquired. Well see what happens if and when Apple adds streaming to iTunes, but its doubtful that Apple will maintain Beats Music as its own brand and independent product.] The fact that the new iPhones did not come pre-installed with Beats Music, while several other Apple apps came loaded on the 6 and 6 Plus, should have been a red flag. There was also nothing said about Beats Music during the Apple Watch reveal, even though the services radio and fire-and-forget playlists could work well on a wearable. In August, Beats Music was being advertised to new users on iOS 7, yet the only time Beats Music got an off-hand mention at the September launch event was when Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new U2 album would be available there. Instead of Beats Music, the Apple Watch features a unannounced music app [Update: Remote app] with a blue play button (top right in the photo below) that instantly started playing songs when tapped during a demo. Considering Apples penchant for simple, unified brands, and how it despises fragmentation, shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Musics CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio, meaning hes already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music. Shutting down Beats Music also meshes with reports that the Beats acquisition was mostly about getting Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dres talent on board, and picking up the headphone business, not about streaming music. Having Beats as a side brand in music accessories flows naturally, but seems clumsy when it comes to software. Weve contacted Apple with a request for comment on its plans for Beat Music. [Update: Response in update above.] Beats has recently launched an Apple TV channel and released a Listen Now integration with Shazam, but both seem like they could have been in the pipeline directly. One Beats Music employee told me some teams on the non-technical side have been told to keep up business as usual. The move will let Apple focus on its flagship music product with its enormous 800 million user base and treasure trove of over 400 million stored credit cards. Beats Musics growth has likely been hampered by its late start compared to competitors like Spotify, Rdio, Google Music, and Pandora. Though its strategy was to differentiate itself through curated playlists and mood-based radio, those failed to capture the attention of mainstream listeners. Thanks to seven-day free trials and multi-month demos through AT&T, 5 million people had tried Beats by May, but only 250,000 had signed up for a paid subscription. Thats pretty small compared to the 10 million paid subscribers and 40 million total listeners on Spotify, and 76.4 million active listeners on Pandora. Yet stacked up against the iTunes userbase, Beats Music is just a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple certainly didnt hesitate to shut down music streaming service Lala after acquiring it. The big question is what will Apple do with streaming music. Buying Beats Music may still assist Apple hear through talent, technology, and industry relationships even without the Beats Music brand. One source said Apple may roll streaming into iTunes. This could be the most logical strategy for Apple if it can find a way to keep its traditional music file download customers happy while opening its catalogue to streaming for early adopters who want to listen from the cloud. Perhaps rather than just buy buttons, there could be play buttons in iTunes, too. Another source said Apple plans to make some significant music announcement in the first half of next year. Apple is in the tricky position of trying to smoothly transition its music business from the download to the streaming era. Digital music sales fell 13.3 percent in 2013, while U.S. streaming grew 32 percent. With streaming eating downloads, Apple will have to make a shift or at least accomodate streaming. But it doesnt just want to ditch sales overnight. 1.26 billion songs and 117.6 million albums were sold online in 2013, providing vital capital to the music industry. Forcing users across the chasm from iTunes to Beats Music seems precarious, especially with on-demand streaming competitors like Spotify and Google Music looking to pounce on potential customers. Its doubtful that Apple would abandon its iTunes brand after 13 years of success just because Beats joined the family. Evolving a unified Apple music service sounds a lot better than having two playing out of sync.

3,Unverified,Apple will acquire social networking app Path.,"A report by PandoDaily, which cites ""a single well-placed source inside Apple’s engineering team.""","In a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables, and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social. According to a single well-placed source inside Apples engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, Its almost done, if not signed already, but its essentially a done deal. If true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers  particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnt fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color. According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnt mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebooks $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to command anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, its unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held love of more lasting, intimate communications. Its certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messaging platform, but its unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYr  Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnt be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnt have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app. Dont be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status. Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back. Update 9/10/14: Morin goes back on transparency pledge, refuses to confirm or deny report that Apple is buying Path",Source: Apple set to acquire Path in an attempt to bolster iOS social cred

3,Unverified,It's alleged he is the ISIS fighter featured in several beheading videos.,"The Washington Post reported that the English-speaking ISIS executioner is ""Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming."" It cites unnamed friends of Emwazi, who told the post that the voice in the video belongs to their former friend. The story also quotes Asim Qureshi, research director at the human rights group CAGE, as saying it's Emwazi. (He met with Emwazi before he left for Syria.) The claim remains Unverified because British and U.S. intelligence officials have refused to confirm or deny it, and as of now there is no conclusive evidence linking Emwazi to the videos. A New York Times report said that the ""story was confirmed by a senior British security official,"" but did not offer a name. CBS news also cited an unnamed official to say the name is correct. We do not mark claims as True based on anonymous sources. The U.S. National Security Council later issued a statement saying, ""We will not comment on ongoing investigations and therefore are not in a position to confirm or deny the identity of this individual.""","This recent footage of ""Jihadi John"" shows his role in the barbaric actions of the Islamic State. (The Washington Post) The world knows him as Jihadi John, the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. [View: The atrocities of the Islamic State] I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John, said one of Emwazis close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him. A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. There was an extremely strong resemblance, Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said when shown one of the videos and asked to confirm whether Emwazi could be Jihadi John. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person, Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September  only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley  that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleys killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. [Read: The Islamic State is failing at being a state] In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues. ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazis family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. [Archives: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings] He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Foreign policy reporter Adam Goldman explains who Mohammed Emwazi is and how The Washington Post discovered his identity. (Gillian Brockell and Alice Li/The Washington Post) Emwazi and two friends  a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib  never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Its unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britains domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. [Read: Reaction to an identity revealed] Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. Emwazi attened the University of Westminster, where he studied computer programming. (Toby Melville/Reuters) The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated, Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again  this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. [Read: A Brooklyn mothers struggle to keep her son from Islamic State] I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait. Mohammed Emwazi, who grew up in west London, is believed to have lived in this house before he left for Syria. (Andy Rain/EPA) Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!! In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation, Qureshi said. In the end, he felt actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions. [Read: Key takeaways of Emwazis path to extremism] Close friends of Emwazis also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Its unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere, one of the friends said. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Its unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility the box. Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed George. A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. [The Islamic State caliphate is in danger of losing its main supply route] Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. He was the most deliberate, a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic States de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. I was wondering if you could send me your number, he wrote. Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.
